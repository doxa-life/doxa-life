/**
 * usePrayerStatistics.js — the ONE authoritative prayer-coverage source of truth.
 *
 * The prayer-tab legend used to COUNT loaded pins client-side (peoplePraying > 0),
 * which produced 435 — but the parent doxa-life site shows 601. They diverged for
 * two reasons: (1) a different field — the parent counts `people_committed > 0`, the
 * client scan counted `people_praying > 0`; and (2) a different record set — the map
 * only counts the pins it has loaded. The server `/api/people-groups/statistics`
 * aggregate is computed over the FULL dataset and is what the parent trusts, so every
 * surface (research-map, simple-map, dashboard, parent site) must read its numbers
 * from HERE instead of recomputing locally.
 *
 * The upstream endpoint returns BOTH metrics; the parent treats the *committed* one as
 * canonical (its server route renames `total_with_prayer_committed` → `total_with_prayer`
 * and `total_with_100_committed` → `total_with_full_prayer`). We mirror that exactly:
 *
 *   withPrayer     = total_with_prayer_committed   (601 — "1+ committed to pray")
 *   withFullPrayer = total_with_100_committed      (0   — full coverage, >= 100 committed)
 *   total          = total                         (2106)
 *
 * → none = total - withPrayer (1505), partial = withPrayer - withFullPrayer (601),
 *   full = withFullPrayer (0). These are the 601 / 1505 / 0 the parent shows.
 *
 * Shared-layer contract: the fetch is a MODULE-LEVEL singleton, so all profiles/legends
 * on a page share ONE request and ONE reactive result — the single source of truth.
 * Uses the same shared data config as the rest of the app (sources.json activeSource
 * endpoint + getApiBaseUrl); no DOM, shadow-DOM safe.
